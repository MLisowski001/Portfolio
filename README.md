# Portfolio
## About me
Stworzyłem poniższe portfolio celem ukazania mojego rozwoju w zakresie testowania oprogramowania. Tematem zainteresował mnie mój obecny mentor, który jest Testerem Oprogramowania. 

I am a software tester. I found out about this profession relatively recently and I liked it very much. After two years of work, I care even more about development, so I have set my daily routine on the priority of learning as much as I can in the field, including test automation. Being a software tester has been a milestone in my professional career and the position of developer is my professional goal due to the variety of tasks and development opportunities.
